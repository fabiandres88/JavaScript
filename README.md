- Callbacks.
- Conditionals.
- Data Types.
- Functions.
- Loops.
- Objects.
- Promises.

# Arrays

## Description:

```
1. Simple matrix addition:

Given a series of integers, find the sum of their
elements.

2. A very large sum:

Calculate and print the sum of the elements of an array,
given:

● You must create a function with an array as a parameter
input.
● The function must add the number of iterations
given, plus, integer values within the
training.

3. Rotation of circular matrix:

John Watson knows an operation called rotation
right circular in an array of integers. An operation of
rotation moves the last element of the array to the first
position and move all remaining items to the
right. For each matrix, perform several rotations
circles to the right and return the value of the element in
a given index:

● Array indicator defined by.
● Number of random rotations between A and B. Show position 2 and 3 of the array, which will have a minimum of 5
positions.

# studentNotes

## Description of the problem:

```
A teacher must calculate the average of the grade of quices of his students to upload it to the final marks platform.
However, the teacher agreed with his students that they will help them eliminate the worst of the 5 marks before calculating
the average that he will eventually report. In addition, the teacher has realized that the notes recorded on his spreadsheet
are on a whole number scale from 0 to 100 but the platform is designed to receive the average only
on the standard college scale: 0 to 5, rounded to two decimal places.

Write a function what passed as parameters: a string with the student's alphanumeric code and five numbers
integers (note1, note2, note3, note4, note5) representing the grades of the semester quices and return a string
character that provides the teacher with the information he wants to obtain. The string should have the following
structure: "The adjusted average of the student {code} is: {average}" where, the reported average must meet
with the descriptions mentioned above (rounded to two decimal places, scaled from 0 to 5 and calculated
eliminating the worst of the five student grades).
