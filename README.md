# JavaScript

Basic exercises of javascript as below:

- Arrays.
- Async-Await.
- Callbacks.
- Closures.
- Conditionals.
- Data Types.
- Functions.
- Loops.
- Objects.
- Promises.
- Scopes.

# Arrays

## Description:

```
1. Simple matrix addition:

Given a series of integers, find the sum of their
elements.

2. A very large sum:

Calculate and print the sum of the elements of an array,
given:

● You must create a function with an array as a parameter
input.
● The function must add the number of iterations
given, plus, integer values within the
training.

3. Rotation of circular matrix:

John Watson knows an operation called rotation
right circular in an array of integers. An operation of
rotation moves the last element of the array to the first
position and move all remaining items to the
right. For each matrix, perform several rotations
circles to the right and return the value of the element in
a given index:

● Array indicator defined by.
● Number of random rotations between A and B.
Show position 2 and 3 of the array, which will have a minimum of 5
positions.

ARRAYS B

1. Stop Enter via speed numbers indefinitely until
the user to enter "Stop."
Store all data in an array and display it at the end.
"Stop" must be outside our matrix.

2. Divide Matrices
Enter using quick numbers until the entry of
a 0.
Create an array for the even numbers, another for the
odd and a third to store non-numeric data.
Show the results at the end of the cycle.
The value 0 does not include it in any arrangement.

3. Eliminate extremes
Enter using quick numbers until the entry of
a 0.
Store the information in an arrangement.
Remove the highest and lowest number from the array.
If the highest or lowest are repeated alone
delete them once.

4. Array, function and exception.
Create a function that passed an array as a parameter and
to return the highest number it contains.

● If the parameter is not an array, throw an exception
● If there is no numeric element, throw an exception 
```

# Asynchronism

## Description:

```
It contains exercises about:
```
- async awzit
- callbacks
- promises

# Booleans

## Description

```
1. The user will enter a number and
we will specify if the number entered
it is odd or even.

2. Request the age of a user.
Then ask him if he is
studying.
Based on both answers, indicate
the result on screen.

3. Obtain the age of a voter and
tell you if you are allowed to vote.
People over the age of 18 vote.

4. A user tries to enter our
system. We will ask for the user and
password.
We will define a password and before it
user input we will define if it has
entered correctly.
Show a message at the exit according to the
case.

5. Ask a user for two numbers to
perform a division.

6.Request first and last name.
Show a welcome message with
the full name.

7. The user must enter the time of
start and end of a
meeting.
If the start date is greater or
equal to completion, display a
error, otherwise indicate that the
information was saved successfully.
```

# Calculator

## Description:

```
This exercise use export module and require, to build a calculator managing the files by separate.
```

# Callbacks

## Description:

```
1. Create a function called "calc" that receives ǽ parameters, the
first an integer the second a function that
we will use as a callback.
Show the following console.logs within each function:
● Hello calc.
● Callback Hello.

2. Create a new function to calculate the square of the
whole number.
Calculate the square of the number through the "calc" function.

3. Invoke a new function through a callback that
let us know the square root of a whole number.

4. Create a new function to find out if a number
integer is prime or not.
Use this new function through "calc".

5. Invoke a new function through a callback that
allows us to know the factorial of the whole number.

6. Generate a function to work as an array.
It must receive 2 parameters, an array and a callback.
Generate a function to add an element to the beginning of the
array and another to add an element to the end.
Generate an inline function that removes the last element.
```

# Closures-scopes

## Description:

```
It contains exercises about:
```

### closure

- closure
- lexical
- loop
- private-variables

### scope

- block
- global
- local

### hoisting


# StudentNotes

## Description of the problem:

```
A teacher must calculate the average of the grade of quices of his students to upload it to the final marks platform.
However, the teacher agreed with his students that they will help them eliminate the worst of the 5 marks before calculating
the average that he will eventually report. In addition, the teacher has realized that the notes recorded on his spreadsheet
are on a whole number scale from 0 to 100 but the platform is designed to receive the average only
on the standard college scale: 0 to 5, rounded to two decimal places.

Write a function what passed as parameters: a string with the student's alphanumeric code and five numbers
integers (note1, note2, note3, note4, note5) representing the grades of the semester quices and return a string
character that provides the teacher with the information he wants to obtain. The string should have the following
structure: "The adjusted average of the student {code} is: {average}" where, the reported average must meet
with the descriptions mentioned above (rounded to two decimal places, scaled from 0 to 5 and calculated
eliminating the worst of the five student grades).
```
