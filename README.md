# studentNotes

## Descripci√≥n del problema:

```
A teacher must calculate the average of the grade of quices of his students to upload it to the final marks platform.
However, the teacher agreed with his students that they will help them eliminate the worst of the 5 marks before calculating
the average that he will eventually report. In addition, the teacher has realized that the notes recorded on his spreadsheet
are on a whole number scale from 0 to 100 but the platform is designed to receive the average only
on the standard college scale: 0 to 5, rounded to two decimal places.

Write a function what passed as parameters: a string with the student's alphanumeric code and five numbers
integers (note1, note2, note3, note4, note5) representing the grades of the semester quices and return a string
character that provides the teacher with the information he wants to obtain. The string should have the following
structure: "The adjusted average of the student {code} is: {average}" where, the reported average must meet
with the descriptions mentioned above (rounded to two decimal places, scaled from 0 to 5 and calculated
eliminating the worst of the five student grades).
